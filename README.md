## Instructions
Download the repository in a folder, the backend is in the cloud so you don't have to run anything for that. Inside the repository go to the folder cours-dev-web-5-vuejs/demo_code/exercise_base/ and open up a command terminal where you have npm installed (if you don't have node js or npm install please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm )). Run the following commands:
* npm install
* npm run serve

Wait until the terminal tells you the server is up and running. Then go to the following url: http://localhost:8080, there you will be able to see the webpage.
